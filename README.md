#GPT for joke annotation

In this work, we annotated a joke dataset with the joint efforts of the three parties: Robotics experts, Psychologists in the field of humor, and GPT-3.  
During the annotation, we elaborated the prompts for GPT-3 to make the most accurate annotation.  
Here are three pieces of code for the annotation:

1. gpt_classify.py is for the humor style classification;  
2. gpt_keyword.py is for the keyword extraction;  
3. gpt_rating.py is for the funninness level rating.
