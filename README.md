#GPT for joke annotation

In this work, we annotated a joke dataset with the joint efforts of the three parties: Robotics experts, Psychologists, and GPT-3.
During the annotation process, we detailed the GPT-3 prompts in order to make the most accurate annotations.  
Here are three pieces of code for the annotation:

1. gpt_classify.py is for the humor style classification;  
2. gpt_keyword.py is for the keyword extraction;  
3. gpt_rating.py is for the funninness level rating.
